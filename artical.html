        <h2> Is it true that the history of humanity began in Africa?</h2>
        
        <p>
        Both of our ancestor were black: according to the rule Gloger, the level of human skin pigmentation depends on the heat and humidity of the surrounding environment, so that living in Africa, the first people had to have dark skin, as well as today's Africans.
        At the same time, Mongoloid and Caucasoid owners of light skin have lost their pigment during the thousands of years spent away from the bright sun, in temperate latitudes. But this happened much later era of the first humans: only a hundred thousand years after the genetic Adam and Eve, their descendants moved out of Africa to go to his great journey around the planet.

        <h2>How long have Africans eaten bananas?</h2>
    
        <p>
            The stereotypical belief that Africans lived exclusively fishing falling from the sky bananas and mangoes are not true. No bananas or mangoes, surprisingly, are not local cultures and were brought to Africa recently. Bananas, for example, arrived with immigrants from the islands of Indonesia.
            But Africans have come up with their own crops: in West Africa domesticated yams (still very common there dish), wild rice (not the one in Asia, but also very tasty), various types of millet and oil palm.
            It is very likely that, in Africa, and has been tamed by a special kind of wild hoofed animals - the ancestors of today's longhorn cows African savannah.

            <h2>Africa has always been famous for its witchcraft. Still common in the continent</h2>
        
            <p>
                Almost any trouble occurring to a person, a family, a city, or even state in Africa today are attributed to witchcraft. Loss of livestock, lack of rain, the sudden death from illness, the death of a newborn baby or a grain crop, eaten by birds inadvertently fallen asleep watchman - all this is only one reason: some of the detractors used the black magic against people. This is a simple explanation, oddly enough, really helps not only to understand the world, but also to cope with difficulties. If a person is sick, it just means that at night on the wing of a bat flew into his house and set up a malicious witch fetish in his body.
            </p>
            
            <P>
                The death is imminent unless the healer (the same wizard, but very good) will not be able to get it. Healer, however, it is usually possible: after a series of ceremonies and manipulation of the body of the sick person he deftly sucks the victim of a sorcerer tuft of grass, feathers, or stones.
                This treatment has a strong psychotherapeutic effect on the patient: feeling like enchanted, people often die simply from fear, after the same procedure "cure" from witchcraft patient will certainly believe in recovery. But if the disease still kill his loved ones will know: spells were too strong, you had to pay more money healer.
                With magic can not handle even the XXI century. The laws of a number of countries, witchcraft is officially forbidden in the Seychelles sorcerers gris-gris outlawed and sought as the most real criminals.
                African governments set up special "witches camps" into which dumped all over the country wizards and witches who were expelled from their relatives houses. Warlocks are often found among the maimed, the lame, the deaf people, they will almost inevitably be considered albinos, often the fear of witchcraft apply to twins, which in many parts of Africa is considered harbingers of disaster for the community.

                    Table Mountain

                    Table Mountain is the most iconic landmark of South Africa.
                    It is also the country’s most photographed attraction and its famous cable car took millions of people to its top.
                    Table Mountain has become the single most welcoming icon to not only our people, but travellers from all over the world.
                    But this mountain hides many surprises that wait to be discovered. It is much more than a scenic photograph background or a place from where you can take a breathtaking photo of Cape Town.
                    There are about 2,200 species of plants found on Table Mountain and 1470 floral species. Many of these plants and flowers are endemic to this mountain.
                    The magnificent Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens are found on the eastern foot of the mountain. Founded in 1913, the garden that spans an area of 1300 acres includes a unique conservatory with plants from different parts of the world.
                    Besides the parks, the whole area has a biodiversity that is rare to find in other places on earth. Its many valleys and streams make it an idyllic getaway from Cape Town. The national park’s most unique feature is its fynbos vegetation that is displayed here better than anywhere in the world.
                    The Cape Floral region of the national park is one of the richest floral regions in the world. Over 70% of the flowers are endemic to the Table Mountain. It is no wonder that the mountain was chosen as one of the new seven world wonders.
                    Its fauna is no less thrilling either. Although animals such as the cape lion, mountain zebra or the leopard are no longer found here, the park is still home to caracals, rock hyraxes or chacma baboons.
                    At the Boulders, penguins flock all over the place, a unique sight in Africa.
                    The flat top peak of the mountain reaches 1,086 m above sea level, but being so close to the sea and to the city its features look more imposing.
